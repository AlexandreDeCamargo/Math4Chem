# CHEM 3PC3 - Mathematical Tools for Chemical Problems 
 
## Course Description 

This course covers essential mathematical topics as tools for solving problems in chemistry. The theme of the first part of the course is thermodynamics calculations. The second part is concerned with linear algebra. Chemical problems associated with equilibrium and kinetics are introduced and solved via calculus and linear algebra. As such, linear algebra - solving systems of linear equations, matrix algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors – and some multivariate calculus topics are introduced in a physical context. The course will also cover a brief introduction to model regression algorithms like neural networks. 
One of the main focuses of the course is the development of coding skills, specifically Python. 
Instruction on the associated programming skills will be provided in tutorials. 

## Resources 

This course does not follow a specific book as it designed to be a collection of topics that are relevant for a common undergraduate program in chemistry. However, if the student wants to consult here are some recommended books:

1.	Applied mathematics for Physical Chemistry, James R. Barrante.
2.	Mathematics for Physical Chemistry, Donald A. McQuarrie.
3.	Physical Chemistry, Ira N. Levine.
4.	Linear Algebra with applications, Gareth Williams.

Notes from previous years wrote by profs. Randy Dumont and Paul Ayers will also be shared.

## Classes 

The classes will be held in ABB 163 on Monday & Thursday 12:30PM - 1:20PM and on Tuesdays 1:30PM - 2:20PM. 

1. Univariate Calculus and Series: Thermodynamic, heat capacity and integration (Sept. 3-6) 

## Tutorials

The tutorials will be held in KTH B132 on Tuesday 12:30 PM – 1:20 PM.
